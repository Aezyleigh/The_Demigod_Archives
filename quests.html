              <strong>Demigods Involved:</strong> Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Grover Underwood.<br>
              <strong>Resolution:</strong> The bolt was never actually stolen; it was planted in Percy's gear by Ares, who was manipulated by Luke, to incite a godly war.<br>

             <strong>Resolution:</strong> The "lost one" was Pan, whom Grover found, and the "final breath" was from the minor god Janus, not a hero. The "love lost" was Rachel's choice to become the Oracle, ending her chance with Percy.
